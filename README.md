# Description

This is a movie information webpage created by React.
Movie information is shown in order of popularity using API of [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

When signing up and logging in, the verification function was based on the react library [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) and [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/), and ui design was used [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

The logged-in user can click the "Add Favorites" button to add it to their Favorites list.

In the Favorite menu, you can delete information about the movie you added.

I used react-redux to implement membership and favorite addition functions, and mongDB and expressJS to implement DB storage and server functions.
